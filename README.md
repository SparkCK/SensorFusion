The Sensor Fusion Nanodegree by Udacity is a great indepth course that covers the topics of LiDAR, camera, and radar fusion techniques. As certain sensors have their strengths and weaknesses, it is important to select the correct suite of sensors for our own applications such as self-driving vehicles. The course on top of these techniques provides a great indepth breakdown of Kalman Filters as they are used to predict and measure the position of objects in space for localization and mapping purposes. Additionally, Extended Kalman Filters (EKFs) and the Unscented Kalman Filters(UKFs) are explored in the course, where I personally prefer the "less-stinky" unscented filter over the lazy approach of linearization around a single point (a small joke based on the history of the two filters~).
